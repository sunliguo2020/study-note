Version 0.3.5
* Start height of random blocks added.
* Improved menus.
* Command-line option "-nomenu" added, which skips menus.
* Terminal resizing better handled.
* Fixed time delays in slow terminals (when printing is slow). This problem
  was observed under cygwin/Win 98 on a 400-MHz Pentium II.
* Drops are ignored when piece is at its spawn position, to prevent
  double-drop mistakes when auto-repeat is fast (or otherwise).
* README file changed.

Version 0.3.4
* Fixed missing flush of output when winner is shown in 2-player mode.
* SIGWINCH signal is now handled, which means that terminal resizing can be
  detected without using Xlib.
* The position line under Top Scores now shows up when score qualifies for the
  highscore list.

Version 0.3.3
* Fixed bugs that cause problems under cygwin and possibly under other
  systems.
* Fixed bug in 1-player mode which caused keys with no action to drop piece
  one row.
* Fixed detection of X window in gnome-terminal.
* Output buffering is now used.
* Interrupt signal is now handled.
* Various other small fixes.
* Two-clause BSD-style licence added.

Version 0.3.2
* Fixed bug that would cause freeze when softdrop key is held down and
  softdrop speed is set to 20 (discovered by Andreas Carlsson). This bug is
  not present in version 0.2.x.
* Fixed bug introduced in 0.3.1 which causes term bg to be set to white on
  every startup.
* New tt-bg mode for drawing blocks added.

Version 0.3.1
* When a horizontal move fails in levels where fall time < lock delay, it is
  performed again when piece is moved down by gravity.
* tt mode added - blocks can be drawn as in Tetris for Terminals.
* Terminal options can be specified on command line.
* Command-line option "-hiscore" can be used to merge highscore files.
* Listing of command-line options with "-help" added.
* Some code cleanup.
